**MaizeFolioID** is a cutting-edge image classification model focused on detecting foliar diseases in maize leaves. This project uses a pre-trained model from ImageNet, fine-tuned to classify specific leaf conditions, aiding in early detection and prevention of crop losses.

The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, designed to distinguish between various foliar diseases. It's an invaluable tool for farmers and agronomists, providing an early warning system to safeguard maize crops.

As a contributor to this project, I played a pivotal role in adapting the ImageNet model to our specific requirements, ensuring its accuracy and reliability in identifying maize leaf diseases. 

The project includes a detailed guide on getting started, prerequisites, dependencies, and how to use the model. Additionally, we have outlined our future roadmap, including the integration of a VisionTransformer model and expanding the dataset for further training.

Here is a snippet of Python code used in the model:
